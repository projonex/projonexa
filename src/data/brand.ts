  story: `Hi, I'm Nisarga Lokhande.

Like many students, I once struggled to turn ideas into working projects — missing the right guidance, documentation, and technical support when it mattered most.

That experience led me to build Projonexa: a place where students, startups, and businesses get structured delivery, expert mentorship, and production-ready results — not half-finished prototypes.

Our mission is simple: make innovation accessible to everyone.`,
